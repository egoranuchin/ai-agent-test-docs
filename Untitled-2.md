# üß≠ User Guide: Building Your First AI Agent in Latenode

## 1. Introduction

AI agents are one of the most exciting developments in artificial intelligence. They can reason, plan, and act autonomously ‚Äî not just follow rigid scripts.

This guide will walk you through building your first **AI Personal Assistant** in **Latenode**, without writing a single line of code.

By the end, you‚Äôll have a working assistant that:

* Reads your emails.
* Schedules meetings in your calendar.
* Manages tasks in your tracker.
* Searches the web for information.
* Responds via chat (Telegram in our example).

## 2. Agents vs Automations

Before building, let‚Äôs clarify a common confusion:

* **Automations**: Run on fixed rules. Example: every morning, fetch WhatsApp messages and send a summary. Predictable, but not adaptive.
* **Agents**: Flexible, dynamic, and reasoning-capable. Example: Ask ‚ÄúWhich specialists is this company hiring?‚Äù and the agent checks the company‚Äôs website or CRM.

üëâ Use **automations** for repetitive, static workflows.
üëâ Use **agents** when reasoning, adaptability, and context matter.

## 3. Core Components of an Agent

Every Latenode agent is built on **three pillars**:

1. **Brain**: A large language model (LLM) such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude. It handles reasoning, planning, and natural language.
2. **Memory**: Lets the agent recall past interactions or preserve session context.
3. **Tools**: External services the agent can use (Gmail, Calendar, task trackers, APIs, etc.).

> üìå **Golden Rule**: Start simple. If a single agent does the job, don‚Äôt overcomplicate it.

---

## 4. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* A [Latenode](https://latenode.com) account.
* Access to the following services:

  * Gmail (for email).
  * Google Calendar.
  * Task tracker (e.g., Todoist).
  * A web search API (e.g., Perplexity).
* A **Telegram bot token** (for interaction). Create one easily with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

---

## 5. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Scenario

1. Log into **Latenode**.
2. Create a **new scenario**.
3. Add an **AI Agent node**.
4. Name your agent (example: `Stanley`).

---

### Step 2: Connect Tools

1. Open the **node list** and add tools:

   * Gmail ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate Draft‚Äù and ‚ÄúRead Inbox.‚Äù
   * Google Calendar ‚Üí ‚ÄúList Events.‚Äù
   * Todoist ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate Task.‚Äù
   * Perplexity ‚Üí ‚ÄúWeb Search.‚Äù
2. Authorize each integration.

   * Fill in credentials in the **Authorization Tab**.
   * Give each connection a descriptive name (e.g., `Work Gmail`, `Personal Calendar`).

üì∏ *\[Insert screenshot: Node list with Gmail, Calendar, Todoist, Perplexity connected]*

---

### Step 3: Configure Tools

For each node:

* **Give it a clear name** (e.g., `List Calendar Events`).
* **Write a short description** so the agent knows when to use it.
* **Fill required fields**:

  * Example: in Calendar, prefill *time zone* but let the agent fill *time min* and *time max*.
* Use **From AI Agent Operator** for dynamic inputs.

üì∏ *\[Insert screenshot: Example node setup with fields highlighted]*

---

### Step 4: Add a Trigger

Decide how your agent should be activated. Options:

* **Run Once** (manual testing).
* **Webhook** (custom app integration).
* **Email Trigger**.
* **Telegram Trigger** (recommended for this guide).

üîπ Example: Telegram Trigger

1. Connect the Telegram node to your bot.
2. Authorize with the token.
3. Add **Send Message** node to reply back.
4. Use variables to store `message` and `chat ID`.

üì∏ *\[Insert screenshot: Telegram trigger + reply flow]*

---

### Step 5: Configure Memory

1. In the AI Agent node, set **Session ID** = `chat ID`.

   * Ensures conversations are linked to each user.
2. Configure **Context Window** (default: 25 messages).

   * Increase for complex tasks.
   * Keep reasonable to avoid confusion or hallucinations.

---

### Step 6: Write the System Prompt

This is the **blueprint** for your agent‚Äôs behavior. Use structured Markdown:

```markdown
# Personality
Friendly and professional personal assistant named Stanley.

# Environment
Works with Gmail, Google Calendar, Todoist, and Web Search.

# Goal
Help the user manage emails, tasks, and schedules efficiently.

# Guardrails
Never share private data. Always confirm before deleting.

# Tools
- Gmail Draft
- Gmail Inbox
- Google Calendar
- Todoist
- Web Search
```

Tips:

* Use Latenode‚Äôs [prompting guide](https://help.latenode.com).
* Iterate and refine based on results.

---

### Step 7: Select Model

* Recommended: **GPT-4.1-mini** (low cost, long context).
* Use **GPT-4.1** for production when higher reliability is needed.

üì∏ *\[Insert screenshot: Model selection dropdown]*

---

### Step 8: Connect Agent Responses

1. Run a test execution of the agent.
2. Inspect JSON response structure.
3. Map agent‚Äôs reply into the **Telegram ‚ÄúSend Message‚Äù node**.

üì∏ *\[Insert screenshot: Mapping agent reply to Telegram]*

---

## 6. Testing the Agent

Try these commands in Telegram:

* **Inbox check:**

  > ‚ÄúDo I have any urgent emails?‚Äù

* **Task scheduling:**

  > ‚ÄúFind time for a payment call tomorrow and add it to my calendar and Todoist.‚Äù

* **Web search:**

  > ‚ÄúSearch the web for news about AI regulation in Europe.‚Äù

‚úÖ Verify that the agent:

* Reads from Gmail.
* Updates your calendar.
* Adds tasks to Todoist.
* Replies in Telegram.

---

## 7. Best Practices

* **Keep it simple.** Use automations for fixed tasks, agents for reasoning.
* **Name tools clearly.** Helps the agent choose the right one.
* **Prompt iteratively.** Test and refine system instructions.
* **Balance memory.** Too much history ‚Üí confusion; too little ‚Üí loss of context.
* **Secure integrations.** Authorize only what‚Äôs needed.

---

## 8. Example Workflow

**Scenario:** Handle an urgent email.

1. User: ‚ÄúCheck my inbox for urgent messages.‚Äù
2. Agent finds one flagged email.
3. User: ‚ÄúSchedule a call to handle payment.‚Äù
4. Agent:

   * Finds free slot in Google Calendar.
   * Adds task in Todoist.
   * Drafts email reply in Gmail.

üëâ All executed in a single conversation.

---

## 9. Next Steps

* Experiment with **multi-agent systems** (supervisor + specialists).
* Try other integrations (Slack, Notion, custom APIs).
* Explore advanced prompt engineering techniques.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

* **Tool error:** Check authorization in the node.
* **No response:** Confirm correct JSON key mapping.
* **Memory issues:** Adjust context window.
* **Wrong behavior:** Refine system prompt.

---

## 11. Glossary

* **Agent**: Reasoning, adaptive automation.
* **Automation**: Fixed, rule-based workflow.
* **Node**: A block in Latenode scenario.
* **Session ID**: Identifier binding memory to a user.
* **System Prompt**: Instruction blueprint for the agent.

‚úçÔ∏è This draft reads like a real **step-by-step user manual** with both narrative and reference sections.

Do you want me to **add diagrams/mock screenshots** (block diagrams of nodes, JSON mapping, etc.) so it feels closer to a PDF/manual ‚Äî or keep it text-only for now?
