# Core Concepts

## What Is an AI Agent?

In simple terms, an AI agent is a system that can:

- Make decisions.
- Plan steps.
- Take actions on its own, based on the information you provide.

Agents in Latenode can:

- Manage entire workflows.
- Call external tools, nodes, and functions.
- Adjust when conditions change.

👉 Picture it as a digital assistant that can think, keep track of context, and actually get work done for you.

## Agents vs Automations

You can create AI automations and AI agents in Latenode. These two are often confused, but they’re not the same.

**Automations**:

- Run on fixed schedules or rules. Example: Every morning, collect WhatsApp messages, process them, and send back a summary.
- Even more advanced automations, like pulling leads from forms and emailing you a brief before a sales call, are still automations. Why? Because they follow a fixed path (A → B → C) with no reasoning involved.

**Agents**:

- Flexible, dynamic, capable of reasoning Example: A lead researcher agent can answer “What specialist is this company currently hiring?” → checks the company’s website; “Which leads have we had from this company?” → it looks in your CRM.

👉 **Automations are static. Agents are adaptive.**

## Core Components of Agents

Every agent is built from **three pieces**:

1. Brain – a large language model (GPT, Gemini, Claude) that handles reasoning, planning, and natural language.
2. Memory – the ability to recall past interactions or fetch context.
3. Tools – how the agent acts in the real world (sending emails, triggering workflows, calling APIs, etc.).

In Latenode, many tools are ready to use out of the box. For anything else, you can connect through an HTTP request node.

👉 No matter how advanced, every agent is built from these **same three parts**.

## Single Agents vs Multi-Agents

When you’re starting out, the smartest move is to start with a single agent system — one agent, one job, simple and clean.

As you get more comfortable, you can build multi-agent setups:

- One agent acts as a supervisor or coordinator.
- Others specialize (e.g., research, outreach, follow-ups).
- Together, they work like a small digital team.

👉 Don’t overcomplicate it. If one agent gets the job done, stick with that. If an automation is better, use that instead.

## What Can You Build?

With Latenode agents you can build, for example:

- A personal assistant that organizes your day.
- A support manager.
- A content personalization bot.
- An SMM helper.
- A legal document reviewer that highlights key points in contracts.

These aren’t futuristic ideas — they’re things you can start experimenting with right now.
