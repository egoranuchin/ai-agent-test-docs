# Introduction

AI agents are quickly becoming one of the most fascinating parts of the artificial intelligence field. They’re rolling out fast, and it can sometimes feel like the world is moving ahead without you.

When you look at demos or tutorials, they might seem overly complicated or too technical. But the reality is actually very different. Agents, for example, are much simpler to grasp than you might think — even if you’ve never written a single line of code.

In this guide, we’ll go step by step:

- What an agent is.
- How it functions.
- What kinds of tasks it can handle.
- And finally, how you can build your very first agent.

The best part: **you won’t need to code at all**.
